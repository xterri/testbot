# Basic Conversation Bot v.0

This is my first attempt at building a chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform. Its current version uses DialogFlow (API.ai) to converse with users.

## Getting Started

Based the bot mostly on tutorials and guides found online (see sources).

First version of the bot repeated the messages from the user back to them.

Second version was to pull movie information from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com). Unfortunately, they no longer provide free access to their database, so could not test the bot properly.

This final version that is currently running is connected to DialogFlow and holds basic conversations with users.

### Demo

The bot is currently connected to my Facebook page, [Terri.Codes](https://www.facebook.com/terri.codes). However, it is still in development mode, so it is not available to the public.

To test the bot, please message me the Facebook account you would like me to add to my list of "Testers".
