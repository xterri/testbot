Create chatbot
	1. make a directory & cd into it
	2. 'npm init' (inside directory). hit enter for all questions (don't need to answer them)
	3. install dependences >> 'npm install express request body-parser --save'
		- install dependencies that allows users to send and receive information from the server
	4. create 'index.js' / 'app.js' file to set up the chatbot(?) server
	5. create ProcFile >> when server called, this file tells server where to look
